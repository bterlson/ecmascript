  <p>This function interprets a string value as a sequence of code points, as described in <a href=
  "#sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">6.1.4</a> .</p>

  <p>This function works exactly the same as <code>toLowerCase</code> except that its result is
  intended to yield the correct result for the host environment’s current locale, rather than a
  locale-independent result. There will only be a difference in the few cases (such as Turkish)
  where the rules for that language conflict with the regular Unicode case mappings.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this
    standard; it is recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for
    anything else.</p>
  </es-note>

  <es-note>
    <p>The <code>toLocaleLowerCase</code> function is intentionally generic; it does not require
    that its <b>this</b> value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds
    of objects for use as a method.</p>
