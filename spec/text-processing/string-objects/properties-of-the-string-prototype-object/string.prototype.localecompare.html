<es-clause title="String.prototype.localeCompare (that, reserved1=undefined, reserved2=undefined )"
anchor="sec-string.prototype.localecompare">
  <p>An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402 International API must implement the
  <code>localeCompare</code> method as specified in the ECMA-402 specification. If an ECMAScript
  implementation does not include the ECMA-402 API the following specification of the
  <code>localeCompare</code> method is used.</p>

  <p>When the <code>localeCompare</code> method is called with argument <es-nt>that</es-nt>, it
  returns a Number other than <b>NaN</b> that represents the result of a locale-sensitive String
  comparison of the <b>this</b> value (converted to a String) with <es-nt>that</es-nt> (converted
  to a String). The two Strings are <es-nt>S</es-nt> and <es-nt>That</es-nt>. The two Strings are
  compared in an implementation-defined fashion. The result is intended to order String values in
  the sort order specified by the system default locale, and will be negative, zero, or positive,
  depending on whether <es-nt>S</es-nt> comes before <es-nt>That</es-nt> in the sort order, the
  Strings are equal, or <es-nt>S</es-nt> comes after <es-nt>That</es-nt> in the sort order,
  respectively.</p>

  <p>Before perform the comparisons the following steps are performed to prepare the Strings:</p>

  <ol class="proc">
    <li>Let <i>O</i> be <a href="#sec-checkobjectcoercible">CheckObjectCoercible</a> (<b>this</b>
    value).
    </li>

    <li>Let <i>S</i> be <a href="#sec-tostring">ToString</a> (<i>O</i>).
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="#sec-returnifabrupt">ReturnIfAbrupt</a> (<i>S</i>).
    </li>

    <li>Let <i>That</i> be <a href="#sec-tostring">ToString</a> (<i>that</i>).
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="#sec-returnifabrupt">ReturnIfAbrupt</a> (<i>That</i>).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The meaning of the optional second and third parameters to this method are defined in the
  ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not include ECMA-402 support must not use those
  parameter position for anything else.</p>

  <p>The <code>localeCompare</code> method, if considered as a function of two arguments
  <b>this</b> and <es-nt>that</es-nt>, is a consistent comparison function (as defined in <a href=
  "#sec-array.prototype.sort">22.1.3.24</a> ) on the set of all Strings.</p>

  <p>The actual return values are implementation-defined to permit implementers to encode
  additional information in the value, but the function is required to define a total ordering on
  all Strings. If the implementation performs language-sensitive comparisions it must return
  <code>0</code> when comparing Strings that are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode
  standard.</p>

  <p>If no language-sensitive comparison at all is available from the host environment, this
  function may perform a bitwise comparison.</p>

  <p>The <code>length</code> property of the <code>localeCompare</code> method is <b>1</b>.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>The <code>localeCompare</code> method itself is not directly suitable as an argument to
    <code><a href="#sec-array.prototype.sort">Array.prototype.sort</a></code> because the latter
    requires a function of two arguments.</p>
  </es-note>

  <es-note>
    <p>This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive comparison functionality is
    available to the ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare according to
    the rules of the host environment’s current locale. This function must treat Strings that are
    canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical. It is also recommended
    that this function not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or decompositions. For a
    definition and discussion of canonical equivalence see the Unicode Standard, chapters 2 and 3,
    as well as Unicode Annex #15, Unicode Normalization Forms and Unicode Technical Note #5
    Canonical Equivalence in Applications. Also see Unicode Technical Stardard #10, Unicode
    Collation Algorithm.</p>
  </es-note>

  <es-note>
    <p>The <code>localeCompare</code> function is intentionally generic; it does not require that
    its <b>this</b> value be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of
    objects for use as a method.</p>
