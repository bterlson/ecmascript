  <p>This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and
  manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not
  intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this
  specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected
  that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and
  other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects,
  whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate
  that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be
  called from an ECMAScript program.</p>

  <p>A <b><i>scripting language</i></b> is a programming language that is used to manipulate,
  customise, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful
  functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a
  mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is
  said to provide a host environment of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of
  the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and
  non-professional programmers. ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting
  language, but has become widely used as a general purpose programming language.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be a <b><i>Web scripting language</i></b>, providing a
  mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a
  Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used both as a general propose
  programming language and to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host
  environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular
  host environment.</p>

  <p>Some of the facilities of ECMAScript are similar to those used in other programming languages;
  in particular C, Java™, Self, and Scheme as described in:</p>

  <es-clause title="Web Scripting" anchor="sec-web-scripting">
    <p>A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including,
    for instance, objects that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas,
    anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output. Further, the host environment provides a
    means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading,
    unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code
    appears within the HTML and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and
    fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction and
    there is no need for a main program.</p>

    <p>A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including
    objects representing requests, clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By
    using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is possible to distribute computation
    between the client and server while providing a customised user interface for a Web-based
    application.</p>

    <p>Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment,
    completing the ECMAScript execution environment.</p>

  <es-clause title="ECMAScript Overview" anchor="sec-ecmascript-overview">
    <p>The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript—not all parts of the language are
    described. This overview is not part of the standard proper.</p>

    <p>ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and
    an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an
    <b><i>object</i></b> is a collection of <b><i>properties</i></b> each with zero or more
    <b><i>attributes</i></b> that determine how each property can be used—for example, when the
    Writable attribute for a property is set to <b>false</b>, any attempt by executed ECMAScript
    code to change the value of the property fails. Properties are containers that hold other
    objects, <b><i>primitive values</i></b>, or <b><i>functions</i></b>. A primitive value is a
    member of one of the following built-in types: <b>Undefined</b>, <b>Null</b>, <b>Boolean</b>,
    <b>Number</b>, <b>Symbol</b> and <b>String</b>; an object is a member of the remaining built-in
    type <b>Object</b>; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an
    object via a property is a <b><i>method</i></b>.</p>

    <p>ECMAScript defines a collection of <b><i>built-in objects</i></b> that round out the
    definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object, the
    <b>Object</b> object, the <b>Function</b> object, the <b>Array</b> object, the <b>String</b>
    object, the <b>Boolean</b> object, the <b>Number</b> object, the <b>Math</b> object, the
    <b>Date</b> object, the <b>RegExp</b> object, the <b>JSON</b> object, and the Error objects
    <b>Error, EvalError</b>, <b>RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError</b> and
    <b><es-xref target=
    "sec-constructor-properties-of-the-global-object-urierror">URIError</es-xref></b>.</p>

    <p>ECMAScript also defines a set of built-in <b><i>operators</i></b>. ECMAScript operators
    include various unary operations, multiplicative operators, additive operators, bitwise shift
    operators, relational operators, equality operators, binary bitwise operators, binary logical
    operators, assignment operators, and the comma operator.</p>

    <p>ECMAScript syntax intentionally resembles Java syntax. ECMAScript syntax is relaxed to
    enable it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language. For example, a variable is not
    required to have its type declared nor are types associated with properties, and defined
    functions are not required to have their declarations appear textually before calls to
    them.</p>

    <es-clause title="Objects" anchor="sec-objects">
      <p>ECMAScript does not use classes such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects
      may be created in various ways including via a literal notation or via
      <b><i>constructors</i></b> which create objects and then execute code that initialises all or
      part of them by assigning initial values to their properties. Each constructor is a function
      that has a property named “<code>prototype</code>” that is used to implement
      <b><i>prototype-based inheritance</i></b> and <b><i>shared properties</i></b>. Objects are
      created by using constructors in <b>new</b> expressions; for example, <code>new
      Date(2009,11)</code> creates a new Date object. Invoking a constructor without using
      <b>new</b> has consequences that depend on the constructor. For example, <code>Date()</code>
      produces a string representation of the current date and time rather than an object.</p>

      <p>Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called the object’s
      <i>prototype</i>) to the value of its constructor’s “<code>prototype</code>” property.
      Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on;
      this is called the <i>prototype chain</i>. When a reference is made to a property in an
      object, that reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the prototype
      chain that contains a property of that name. In other words, first the object mentioned
      directly is examined for such a property; if that object contains the named property, that is
      the property to which the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named
      property, the prototype for that object is examined next; and so on.</p>

        <figcaption>
          Figure 1 — Object/Prototype Relationships
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances,
      methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In
      ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and
      state are all inherited.</p>

      <p>All objects that do not directly contain a particular property that their prototype
      contains share that property and its value. Figure 1 illustrates this:</p>

      <p><b>CF</b> is a constructor (and also an object). Five objects have been created by using
      <code>new</code> expressions: <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>,
      <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. Each of these
      objects contains properties named q1 and q2. The dashed lines represent the implicit
      prototype relationship; so, for example, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>’s prototype is
      <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>. The constructor, <b>CF</b>, has two properties itself, named P1 and
      P2, which are not visible to <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>,
      <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, or
      <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. The property named CFP1 in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b> is shared by
      <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>,
      and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> (but not by <b>CF</b>), as are any properties found in
      <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>’s implicit prototype chain that are not named q1, q2, or CFP1. Notice
      that there is no implicit prototype link between <b>CF</b> and <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>

      <p>Unlike class-based object languages, properties can be added to objects dynamically by
      assigning values to them. That is, constructors are not required to name or assign values to
      all or any of the constructed object’s properties. In the above diagram, one could add a new
      shared property for <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>,
      <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> by assigning a new value to the property in
      <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>
    </es-clause>

    <es-clause title="The Strict Variant of ECMAScript" anchor="sec-strict-variant-of-ecmascript">
      <p>The ECMAScript Language recognises the possibility that some users of the language may
      wish to restrict their usage of some features available in the language. They might do so in
      the interests of security, to avoid what they consider to be error-prone features, to get
      enhanced error checking, or for other reasons of their choosing. In support of this
      possibility, ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The strict variant of the
      language excludes some specific syntactic and semantic features of the regular ECMAScript
      language and modifies the detailed semantics of some features. The strict variant also
      specifies additional error conditions that must be reported by throwing error exceptions in
      situations that are not specified as errors by the non-strict form of the language.</p>

      <p>The strict variant of ECMAScript is commonly referred to as the <i>strict mode</i> of the
      language. Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode syntax and semantics of ECMAScript
      is explicitly made at the level of individual ECMAScript code units. Because strict mode is
      selected at the level of a syntactic code unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions that
      have local effect within such a code unit. Strict mode does not restrict or modify any aspect
      of the ECMAScript semantics that must operate consistently across multiple code units. A
      complete ECMAScript program may be composed for both strict mode and non-strict mode
      ECMAScript code units. In this case, strict mode only applies when actually executing code
      that is defined within a <es-xref target="sec-strict-mode-code">strict mode code</es-xref>
      unit.</p>

      <p>In order to conform to this specification, an ECMAScript implementation must implement
      both the full unrestricted ECMAScript language and the strict mode variant of the ECMAScript
      language as defined by this specification. In addition, an implementation must support the
      combination of unrestricted and <es-xref target="sec-strict-mode-code">strict mode
      code</es-xref> units into a single composite program.</p>
