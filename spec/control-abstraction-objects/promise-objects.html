<es-clause title="Promise Objects" anchor="sec-promise-objects">
  <p>A Promise is an object that that is used as a place holder for the eventual results of a
  deferred (and possibly asynchromous) computation.</p>

  <p>Any Promise object is in one of three mutually exclusive states: <i>fulfilled</i>,
  <i>rejected</i>, and <i>pending</i>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A promise <code>p</code> is fulfilled if <code>p.then(f, r)</code> will immediately
      enqueue a Task to call the function <code>f</code>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A promise <code>p</code> is rejected if <code>p.then(f, r)</code> will immediately enqueue
      a Task to call the function <code>r</code>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A promise is pending if it is neither fulfilled nor rejected.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>A promise said to be <i>settled</i> if it is not pending, i.e. if it is either fulfilled or
  rejected.</p>

  <p>A promise is <i>resolved</i> if it is settled or if it has been "locked in" match the state of
  another promise. trying to Attempting to resolve or reject a resolved promise has no effect. A
  promise is <i>unresolved</i> if it is not resolved. A unresolved promise is always in the pending
  state. A resolved promise may be pending, fullfiled, pending.</p>
