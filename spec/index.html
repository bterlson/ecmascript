  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being
  JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at
  Netscape and first appeared in that company’s Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all
  subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet
  Explorer 3.0.</p>

  <p>The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma
  Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.</p>

  <p>That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure,
  and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of
  June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262.
  Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.</p>

  <p>The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string
  handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors,
  formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming
  internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript
  standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC
  16262:2002 in June 2002.</p>

  <p>Since publication of the third edition, ECMAScript has achieved massive adoption in
  conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is
  supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition
  of ECMAScript. Although that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of
  ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution of the language. The fifth edition of ECMAScript
  (published as ECMA-262 5<sup>th</sup> edition) codifies de facto interpretations of the language
  specification that have become common among browser implementations and adds support for new
  features that have emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include
  accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property
  attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format,
  and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security.</p>

  <p>The edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard has been fully aligned with the third edition of
  the international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011.</p>

  <p>This present sixth edition of the Standard………</p>

  <p>ECMAScript is a vibrant language and the evolution of the language is not complete.
  Significant technical enhancement will continue with future editions of this specification.</p>

  <p>This Ecma Standard has been adopted by the General Assembly of &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;.</p>
