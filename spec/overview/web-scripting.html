<es-clause title="Web Scripting" anchor="sec-web-scripting">
  <p>A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including,
  for instance, objects that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors,
  frames, history, cookies, and input/output. Further, the host environment provides a means to
  attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading, unloading, error
  and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML
  and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed text
  and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction and there is no need for a main
  program.</p>

  <p>A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including
  objects representing requests, clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By
  using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is possible to distribute computation
  between the client and server while providing a customised user interface for a Web-based
  application.</p>

  <p>Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment,
  completing the ECMAScript execution environment.</p>
