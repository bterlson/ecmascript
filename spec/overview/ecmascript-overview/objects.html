<es-clause title="Objects" anchor="sec-objects">
  <p>ECMAScript does not use classes such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may
  be created in various ways including via a literal notation or via <b><i>constructors</i></b>
  which create objects and then execute code that initialises all or part of them by assigning
  initial values to their properties. Each constructor is a function that has a property named
  “<code>prototype</code>” that is used to implement <b><i>prototype-based inheritance</i></b> and
  <b><i>shared properties</i></b>. Objects are created by using constructors in <b>new</b>
  expressions; for example, <code>new Date(2009,11)</code> creates a new Date object. Invoking a
  constructor without using <b>new</b> has consequences that depend on the constructor. For
  example, <code>Date()</code> produces a string representation of the current date and time rather
  than an object.</p>

  <p>Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called the object’s
  <i>prototype</i>) to the value of its constructor’s “<code>prototype</code>” property.
  Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this
  is called the <i>prototype chain</i>. When a reference is made to a property in an object, that
  reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the prototype chain that
  contains a property of that name. In other words, first the object mentioned directly is examined
  for such a property; if that object contains the named property, that is the property to which
  the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named property, the prototype for that
  object is examined next; and so on.</p>

  <p>In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods
  are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the
  state and methods are carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and state are all
  inherited.</p>

  <p>All objects that do not directly contain a particular property that their prototype contains
  share that property and its value. Figure 1 illustrates this:</p>

  <p><b>CF</b> is a constructor (and also an object). Five objects have been created by using
  <code>new</code> expressions: <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>,
  <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. Each of these objects
  contains properties named q1 and q2. The dashed lines represent the implicit prototype
  relationship; so, for example, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>’s prototype is <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>. The
  constructor, <b>CF</b>, has two properties itself, named P1 and P2, which are not visible to
  <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>,
  <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, or <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. The property named CFP1 in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>
  is shared by <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>,
  <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> (but not by <b>CF</b>), as are any properties
  found in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>’s implicit prototype chain that are not named q1, q2, or CFP1.
  Notice that there is no implicit prototype link between <b>CF</b> and <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>

  <p>Unlike class-based object languages, properties can be added to objects dynamically by
  assigning values to them. That is, constructors are not required to name or assign values to all
  or any of the constructed object’s properties. In the above diagram, one could add a new shared
  property for <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>,
  <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> by assigning a new value to the property in
  <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>
