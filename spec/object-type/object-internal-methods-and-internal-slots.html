<es-clause title="Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots" anchor=
"sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">
  <p>The actual semantics of objects, in ECMAScript, are specified via algorithms called
  <i>internal methods</i>. Each object in an ECMAScript engine is associated with a set of internal
  methods that defines its runtime behaviour. These internal methods are not part of the ECMAScript
  language. They are defined by this specification purely for expository purposes. However, each
  object within an implementation of ECMAScript must behave as specified by the internal methods
  associated with it. The exact manner in which this is accomplished is determined by the
  implementation.</p>

  <p>Internal method names are polymorphic. This means that different object values may perform
  different algorithms when a common internal method name is invoked upon them. If, at runtime, the
  implementation of an algorithm attempts to use an internal method of an object that the object
  does not support, a <b>TypeError</b> exception is thrown.</p>

  <p>Internal slots correspond to internal state that is associated with objects and used by
  various ECMAScript specification algorithms. Internal slots are not object properties and they
  are not inherited. Depending upon the specific internal slot specification, such state may
  consist of values of any <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language
  type</es-xref> or of specific ECMA specification type values. Unless explicitly specified
  otherwise, internal slots are allocated as part of the process of creating an object and may not
  be dynamically added to an object. Unless specified otherwise, the initial value of an internal
  slot is the value <span class="value">undefined</span>. Various algorithms within this
  specification create objects that have internal slots. However, the ECMAScript language provides
  no direct way to associate internal slots with an object.</p>

  <p>Internal methods and internal slots are identified within this specification using names
  enclosed in double square brackets [[ ]].</p>

  <p><a href="#table-5">Table 5</a> summarises the <i>essential internal methods</i> used by this
  specification that are applicable to all objects created or manipulated by ECMAScript code. Every
  object must have algorithms for all of the essential internal methods. However, all objects do
  not necessarily use the same algorithms for those methods.</p>

  <p>The “Signature” column of <a href="#table-5">Table 5</a> and other similar tables describes
  the invocation pattern for each internal method. The invocation pattern always includes a
  parenthesised list of descriptive parameter names. If a parameter name is the same as an
  ECMAScript type name then the name describes the required type of the parameter value. If an
  internal method explicitly returns a value, its parameter list is followed by the symbol “→” and
  the type name of the returned value. The type names used in signatures refer to the types defined
  in clause 6 augmented by the following additional names. “<i>any</i>” means the value may be any
  <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language type</es-xref>. An internal
  method implicitly returns a <es-xref target="sec-completion-record-specification-type">Completion
  Record</es-xref> as described in <es-xref target=
  "sec-completion-record-specification-type">6.2.2</es-xref>. In addition to its parameters, an
  internal method always has access to the object upon which it is invoked as a method.</p>
