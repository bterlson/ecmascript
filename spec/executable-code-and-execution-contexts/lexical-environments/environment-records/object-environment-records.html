<es-clause title="Object Environment Records" anchor="sec-object-environment-records">
  <p>Each object environment record is associated with an object called its <i>binding object</i>.
  An object environment record binds the set of string identifier names that directly correspond to
  the property names of its binding object. Property keys that are not strings in the form of an
  <es-nt>IdentifierName</es-nt> are not included in the set of bound identifiers. Both own and
  inherited properties are included in the set regardless of the setting of their [[Enumerable]]
  attribute. Because properties can be dynamically added and deleted from objects, the set of
  identifiers bound by an object environment record may potentially change as a side-effect of any
  operation that adds or deletes properties. Any bindings that are created as a result of such a
  side-effect are considered to be a mutable binding even if the Writable attribute of the
  corresponding property has the value <b>false</b>. Immutable bindings do not exist for object
  environment records.</p>

  <p>Object environment records also have a possibly empty <es-xref target=
  "sec-list-and-record-specification-type">List</es-xref> of strings called
  <es-nt>unscopables</es-nt>. The strings in this <es-xref target=
  "sec-list-and-record-specification-type">List</es-xref> are excluded from the environment records
  set of bound names, regardless of whether or not they exist as property keys of its binding
  object.</p>

  <p>Object environment records created for <code>with</code> statements (<es-xref target=
  "sec-with-statement">13.10</es-xref>) can provide their binding object as an implicit this value
  for use in function calls. The capability is controlled by a <es-nt>withEnvironment</es-nt>
  Boolean value that is associated with each object environment record. By default, the value of
  <es-nt>withEnvironment</es-nt> is <b>false</b> for any object environment record.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of the concrete specification methods for Object Environment Records is defined
  by the following algorithms.</p>
