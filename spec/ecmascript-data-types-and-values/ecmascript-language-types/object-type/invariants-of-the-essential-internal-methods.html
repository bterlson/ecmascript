<es-clause title="Invariants of the Essential Internal Methods" anchor=
"sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods">
  <p>The Internal Methods of Objects of an ECMAScript engine must conform to the list of invariants
  specified below. Ordinary ECMAScript Objects as well as all standard exotic objects in this
  specification maintain these invariants. ECMAScript Proxy objects maintain these invariants by
  means of runtime checks on the result of traps invoked on the [[ProxyHandler]] object.</p>

  <p>Any implementation provided exotic objects must also maintain these invariants for those
  objects. Violation of these invariants may cause ECMAScript code to have unpredictable behavior
  and create security issues. However, violation of these invariants must never compromise the
  memory safety of an implementation.</p>

  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The <i>target</i> of an internal method is the object the internal method is called
      upon.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A target is <i>non-extensible</i> if it has been observed to return <span class=
      "value">false</span> from its [[IsExtensible]] internal method, or <span class=
      "value">true</span> from its [[PreventExtensions]] internal method.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A <i>non-existent property</i> is a property that does not exist as an own property on a
      non-extensible target.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Any references to <es-xref target="sec-samevalue">SameValue</es-xref> are according to the
      definition of <es-xref target="sec-samevalue">SameValue</es-xref> algorithm specified in
      <es-xref target="sec-samevalue">7.2.3</es-xref>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>[[GetPrototypeOf]] ( )</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The Type of the return value must be either Object or Null.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If target is non-extensible, and [[GetPrototypeOf]] returns a value v, then any future
      calls to [[GetPrototypeOf]] should return the <es-xref target=
      "sec-samevalue">SameValue</es-xref> as v.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>An object’s prototype chain must have finite length (that is, starting from any object,
      recursively applying the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal method to its result must eventually
      lead to the value <span class="value">null</span>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>[[SetPrototypeOf]] (V)</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The Type of the return value must be Boolean.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If target is non-extensible, [[SetPrototypeOf]] must return false, unless V is the
      <es-xref target="sec-samevalue">SameValue</es-xref> as the target’s observed
      [[GetPrototypeOf]] value.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>[[PreventExtensions]] ( )</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The Type of the return value must be Boolean.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If [[PreventExtensions]] returns <span class="value">true</span>, all future calls to
      [[IsExtensible]] must return <span class="value">false</span> and the target is now
      considered non-extensible.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>[[GetOwnProperty]] (P)</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The Type of the return value must be either Object or Undefined.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the Type of the return value is Object, that object must be a complete property
      descriptor (<es-xref target="sec-completepropertydescriptor">see 6.2.4.6</es-xref>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If a property is described as a data property and it may return different values over
      time, then either or both of the Desc.[[Writable]] and Desc.[[Configurable]] attributes must
      be <span class="value">true</span> even if no mechanism to change the value is exposed via
      the other internal methods.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If a property P is described as a data property with Desc.[[Value]] equal to v and
      Desc.[[Writable]] and Desc.[[Configurable]] are both <span class="value">false</span>, then
      the <es-xref target="sec-samevalue">SameValue</es-xref> must be returned for the
      Desc.[[Value]] attribute of the property on all future calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] ( P ).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If P’s attributes other than [[Writable]] may change over time or if the property might
      disappear, then P’s [[Configurable]] attribute must be <span class="value">true</span>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the [[Writable]] attribute may change from <span class="value">false</span> to
      <span class="value">true</span>, then the [[Configurable]] attribute must be true.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the target is non-extensible and P is non-existent, then all future calls to
      [[GetOwnProperty]] (P) must describe P as non-existent (i.e. [[GetOwnProperty]] (P) must
      return <span class="value">undefined</span>)</p>
