  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all the types, values,
  objects, properties, functions, and program syntax and semantics described in this
  specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must interpret characters in conformance with the
  Unicode Standard, Version 5.1.0 or later and ISO/IEC 10646. If the adopted ISO/IEC 10646-1 subset
  is not otherwise specified, it is presumed to be the Unicode set, collection 10646.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript that provides an application programming interface
  that supports programs that need to adapt to the linguistic and cultural conventions used by
  different human languages and countries must implement the interface defined by the most recent
  edition of ECMA-402 that is compatible with this specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript may provide additional types, values, objects,
  properties, and functions beyond those described in this specification. In particular, a
  conforming implementation of ECMAScript may provide properties not described in this
  specification, and values for those properties, for objects that are described in this
  specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript may support program and regular expression syntax
  not described in this specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of ECMAScript may
  support program syntax that makes use of the “future reserved words” listed in
  sub<es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar">clause 11</es-xref>.6.2.2 of this
  specification.</p>
