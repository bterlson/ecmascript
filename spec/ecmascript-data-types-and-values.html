<es-clause title="ECMAScript Data Types and Values" anchor="sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values">
  <p>Algorithms within this specification manipulate values each of which has an associated type.
  The possible value types are exactly those defined in this clause. Types are further
  subclassified into ECMAScript language types and specification types.</p>

  <p>Within this specification, the notation “Type(<i>x</i>)” is used as shorthand for “the type of
  <i>x</i>” where “type” refers to the ECMAScript language and specification types defined in this
  clause.</p>

  <es-clause title="ECMAScript Language Types" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types">
    <p>An ECMAScript language type corresponds to values that are directly manipulated by an
    ECMAScript programmer using the ECMAScript language. The ECMAScript language types are
    Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Symbol, Number, and Object. An ECMAScript language value is a
    value that is characterized by an ECMAScript language type.</p>

    <es-clause title="The Undefined Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-undefined-type">
      <p>The Undefined type has exactly one value, called <b>undefined</b>. Any variable that has
      not been assigned a value has the value <b>undefined</b>.</p>
    </es-clause>

    <es-clause title="The Null Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-null-type">
      <p>The Null type has exactly one value, called <b>null</b>.</p>
    </es-clause>

    <es-clause title="The Boolean Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-boolean-type">
      <p>The Boolean type represents a logical entity having two values, called <b>true</b> and
      <b>false</b>.</p>
    </es-clause>

    <es-clause title="The String Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">
      <p>The String type is the set of all finite ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned
      integer values (“elements”). The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a
      running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16
      code unit value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within the sequence. These
      positions are indexed with nonnegative integers. The first element (if any) is at index 0,
      the next element (if any) at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of
      elements (i.e., 16-bit values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore
      contains no elements.</p>

      <p>Where ECMAScript operations interpret String values, each element is interpreted as a
      single UTF-16 code unit. However, ECMAScript does not place any restrictions or requirements
      on the sequence of code units in a String value, so they may be ill-formed when interpreted
      as UTF-16 code unit sequences. Operations that do not interpret String contents treat them as
      sequences of undifferentiated 16-bit unsigned integers. No operations ensure that Strings are
      in a normalized form. Only operations that are explicitly specified to be language or locale
      sensitive produce language-sensitive results</p>

      <es-note>
        <p>The rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of Strings as simple and
        high-performing as possible. If ECMAScript source code is in Normalised Form C, string
        literals are guaranteed to also be normalised, as long as they do not contain any Unicode
        escape sequences.</p>
      </es-note>

      <p>Some operations interpret String contents as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code points. In that
      case the interpretation is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A code unit in the range 0 to 0xD7FF or in the range 0xE000 to 0xFFFF is interpreted
          as a code point with the same value.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit <es-nt>c1</es-nt> is in the
          range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF and the second code unit <es-nt>c2</es-nt> is in the range 0xDC00
          to 0xDFFF, is a surrogate pair and is interpreted as a code point with the value
          (<es-nt>c1</es-nt> - 0xD800) × 0x400 + (<es-nt>c2</es-nt> – 0xDC00) + 0x10000.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A code unit that is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF, but is not part of a surrogate
          pair, is interpreted as a code point with the same value.</p>

      <p>The Symbol type is the set of all non-String values that may be used as the key of an

      <p>Each possible Symbol values is unique and immutable.</p>

      <p>Symbol values have an associated internal attribute called [[Description]] whose immutable
      value is either <span class="value">undefined</span> or a String value.</p>

        <p>Well-known symbols are built-in Symbol values that are explicitly referenced by

    <es-clause title="The Number Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type">
      <p>The Number type has exactly 18437736874454810627 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>53</sup>
      +3) values, representing the double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values as specified in
      the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the 9007199254740990
      (that is, 2<sup>53</sup> −2) distinct “Not-a-Number” values of the IEEE Standard are
      represented in ECMAScript as a single special <b>NaN</b> value. (Note that the <b>NaN</b>
      value is produced by the program expression <code>NaN</code>.) In some implementations,
      external code might be able to detect a difference between various Not-a-Number values, but
      such behaviour is implementation-dependent; to ECMAScript code, all NaN values are
      indistinguishable from each other.</p>

      <p>There are two other special values, called <b>positive Infinity</b> and <b>negative
      Infinity</b>. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the
      symbols <span class="value">+∞</span> and <span class="value">−∞</span>, respectively. (Note
      that these two infinite Number values are produced by the program expressions
      <code>+Infinity</code> (or simply <code>Infinity</code>) and <code>-Infinity</code>.)</p>

      <p>The other 18437736874454810624 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>53</sup> ) values are
      called the finite numbers. Half of these are positive numbers and half are negative numbers;
      for every finite positive Number value there is a corresponding negative value having the
      same magnitude.</p>

      <p>Note that there is both a <b>positive zero</b> and a <b>negative zero</b>. For brevity,
      these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols <span class=
      "value">+0</span> and <span class="value">−0</span>, respectively. (Note that these two
      different zero Number values are produced by the program expressions <code>+0</code> (or
      simply <code>0</code>) and <code>-0</code>.)</p>

      <p>The 18437736874454810622 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>53</sup> −2) finite nonzero
      values are of two kinds:</p>

      <p>18428729675200069632 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>54</sup> ) of them are normalised,
      having the form</p>

      <div class="math-display">
        <i>s</i> × <i>m</i> × 2<sup><i>e</i></sup>
      </div>

      <p>where <es-nt>s</es-nt> is +1 or −1, <es-nt>m</es-nt> is a positive integer less than
      2<sup>53</sup> but not less than 2<sup>52</sup> , and <es-nt>e</es-nt> is an integer ranging
      from −1074 to 971, inclusive.</p>

      <p>The remaining 9007199254740990 (that is, 2<sup>53</sup> −2) values are denormalised,
      having the form</p>

      <div class="math-display">
        <i>s</i> × <i>m</i> × 2<sup><i>e</i></sup>
      </div>

      <p>where <es-nt>s</es-nt> is +1 or −1, <es-nt>m</es-nt> is a positive integer less than
      2<sup>52</sup> , and <es-nt>e</es-nt> is −1074.</p>

      <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no greater than
      2<sup>53</sup> are representable in the Number type (indeed, the integer 0 has two
      representations, <code>+0</code> and <code>-0</code>).</p>

      <p>A finite number has an <i>odd significand</i> if it is nonzero and the integer
      <es-nt>m</es-nt> used to express it (in one of the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise,
      it has an <i>even significand</i>.</p>

      <p>In this specification, the phrase “the Number value for <i>x</i>” where <es-nt>x</es-nt>
      represents an exact nonzero real mathematical quantity (which might even be an irrational
      number such as π) means a Number value chosen in the following manner. Consider the set of
      all finite values of the Number type, with <span class="value">−0</span> removed and with two
      additional values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely
      2<sup>1024</sup> (which is +1 × 2<sup>53</sup> × 2<sup>971</sup> ) and −2<sup>1024</sup>
      (which is −1 × 2<sup>53</sup> × 2<sup>971</sup> ). Choose the member of this set that is
      closest in value to <es-nt>x</es-nt>. If two values of the set are equally close, then the
      one with an even significand is chosen; for this purpose, the two extra values
      2<sup>1024</sup> and −2<sup>1024</sup> are considered to have even significands. Finally, if
      2<sup>1024</sup> was chosen, replace it with <span class="value">+∞</span>; if
      −2<sup>1024</sup> was chosen, replace it with <span class="value">−∞</span>; if <span class=
      "value">+0</span> was chosen, replace it with <span class="value">−0</span> if and only if
      <es-nt>x</es-nt> is less than zero; any other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is
      the Number value for <es-nt>x</es-nt>. (This procedure corresponds exactly to the behaviour
      of the IEEE 754 “round to nearest” mode.)</p>

      <p>Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in the range −2<sup>31</sup> through
      2<sup>31</sup> −1, inclusive, or in the range 0 through 2<sup>32</sup> −1, inclusive. These
      operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each such value to one of
      2<sup>32</sup> integer values. See the descriptions of the <es-xref target=
      "sec-toint32">ToInt32</es-xref> and <es-xref target="sec-touint32">ToUint32</es-xref>
      operators in <es-xref target="sec-toint32">7.1.5</es-xref> and <es-xref target=
      "sec-touint32">7.1.6</es-xref>, respectively.</p>
    </es-clause>

    <es-clause title="The Object Type" anchor="sec-object-type">
      <p>An Object is logically a collection of properties. Each property is either a data
      property, or an accessor property:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A <i>data property</i> associates a key value with an <es-xref target=

          attributes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>An <i>accessor property</i> associates a key value with one or two accessor functions,
          and a set of Boolean attributes. The accessor functions are used to store or retrieve an
          <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language value</es-xref> that
          is associated with the property.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either an ECMAScript String
      value or a Symbol value. All String and Symbol values, including the empty string, are valid
      as property keys.</p>

      <p>Property keys are used to access properties and their values. There are two kinds of
      access for properties: <i>get</i> and <i>set</i>, corresponding to value retrieval and
      assignment, respectively. The properties accessible via get and set access includes both
      <i>own properties</i> that are a direct part of an object and <i>inherited properties</i>
      which are provided by another associated object via a property inheritance relationship.
      Inherited properties may be either own or inherited properties of the associated object. Each
      own properties of an object must each have a key value that is distinct from the key values
      of the other own properties of that object.</p>

      <p>All objects are logically collections of properties, but there are multiple forms of
      objects that differ in their semantics for accessing and manipulating their properties.
      O<i>rdinary objects</i> are the most common form of objects and have the default object
      semantics. An <i>exotic object</i> is any form of object whose property semantics differ in
      any way from the default semantics.</p>
