<es-clause title="ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects" anchor=
"sec-ecmascript-standard-built-in-objects">
  <p>There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript <es-nt>Script</es-nt>
  begins execution. One, the global object, is part of the <a href=
  "#sec-lexical-environments">lexical environment</a> of the executing program. Others are
  accessible as initial properties of the global object or indirectly as properties of accessible
  built-in objects.</p>

  <p>Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function is a Built-in
  Function object with the characteristics described in <a href=
  "#sec-built-in-function-objects">9.3</a> . Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]]
  <a href="#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">internal slot</a> of a built-in object
  initially has the value <b>true</b>. Every built-in object has a [[Realm]] <a href=
  "#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">internal slot</a> whose value is the code
  <a href="#sec-code-realms">Realm</a> for which the object was initially created.</p>

  <p>Many built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with arguments. Some of them
  furthermore are constructors: they are functions intended for use with the <code>new</code>
  operator. For each built-in function, this specification describes the arguments required by that
  function and properties of the Function object. For each built-in constructor, this specification
  furthermore describes properties of the prototype object of that constructor and properties of
  specific object instances returned by a <code>new</code> expression that invokes that
  constructor.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function
  or constructor is given fewer arguments than the function is specified to require, the function
  or constructor shall behave exactly as if it had been given sufficient additional arguments, each
  such argument being the <b>undefined</b> value.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function
  or constructor described is given more arguments than the function is specified to allow, the
  extra arguments are evaluated by the call and then ignored by the function. However, an
  implementation may define implementation specific behaviour relating to such arguments as long as
  the behaviour is not the throwing of a <b>TypeError</b> exception that is predicated simply on
  the presence of an extra argument.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>Implementations that add additional capabilities to the set of built-in functions are
    encouraged to do so by adding new functions rather than adding new parameters to existing
    functions.</p>
  </es-note>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in constructor has the
  Function prototype object, which is the initial value of the expression
  <code>Function.prototype</code> (<a href=
  "#sec-properties-of-the-function-prototype-object">19.2.3</a> ), as the value of its
  [[Prototype]] <a href="#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">internal slot</a> .</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in prototype object has the Object prototype object,
  which is the initial value of the expression <code>Object.prototype</code> (<a href=
  "#sec-properties-of-the-object-prototype-object">19.1.3</a> ), as the value of its [[Prototype]]
  <a href="#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">internal slot</a> , except the Object
  prototype object itself.</p>

  <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the
  [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
  function.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified, every built-in function defined in clauses 18 through 26 are
  created as if by calling the <a href="#sec-createbuiltinfunction">CreateBuiltinFunction</a>
  abstract operation (<a href=
  "#sec-built-in-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist">9.3.1</a> ).</p>

  <p>Every built-in Function object, including constructors, has a <code>length</code> property
  whose value is an integer. Unless otherwise specified, this value is equal to the largest number
  of named arguments shown in the subclause headings for the function description, including
  optional parameters.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>For example, the Function object that is the initial value of the slice property of the
    String prototype object is described under the subclause heading “<a href=
    "#sec-string.prototype.slice">String.prototype.slice</a> (start, end)” which shows the two
    named arguments start and end; therefore the value of the length property of that Function
    object is 2.</p>
  </es-note>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the <code>length</code> property of a built-in Function object has
  the attributes {&nbsp;[[Writable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]:
  <b>true</b> }.</p>

  <p>Every built-in Function object, including constructors, that is not identified as an anonymous
  function has a <code>name</code> property whose value is a String. Unless otherwise specified,
  this value is the name that is given to the function in this specification. For functions that
  are specified as properties of objects, the name value is the property name string used to access
  the function. Functions that are specified as get or set accessor functions of built-in
  properties have "<code>get</code> " or "<code>set</code> " prepended to the property name string.
  The value of the <code>name</code> property is explicitly specified for each built-in functions
  whose <a href="#sec-object-type">property key</a> is a symbols value.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the <code>name</code> property of a built-in Function object has
  the attributes {&nbsp;[[Writable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]:
  <b>true</b> }.</p>

  <p>Every other data property described in clauses 18 through 26 has the attributes {
  [[Writable]]: <b>true</b>, [[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]: <b>true</b> } unless
  otherwise specified.</p>

  <p>Every accessor property described in clauses 18 through 26 has the attributes {[[Enumerable]]:
  <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]: <b>true</b> } unless otherwise specified. If only a get accessor
  function is described, the set accessor function is the default value, <b>undefined</b>. If only
  a set accessor is function is described the get accessor is the default value,
  <b>undefined</b>.</p>
</es-clause>
