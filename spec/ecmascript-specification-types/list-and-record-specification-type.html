<es-clause title="The List and Record Specification Type" anchor=
"sec-list-and-record-specification-type">
  <p>The List type is used to explain the evaluation of argument lists (see <es-xref target=
  "sec-argument-lists">12.2.6</es-xref>) in <code>new</code> expressions, in function calls, and in
  other algorithms where a simple ordered list of values is needed. Values of the List type are
  simply ordered sequences of list elements containing the individual values. These sequences may
  be of any length. The elements of a list may be randomly accessed using 0-origin indices. For
  notational convience an array-like syntax can be used to access List elements. For example,
  <i>arguments</i>[2] is shorthand for saying the 3<sup>th</sup> element of the List
  <i>arguments</i>.</p>

  <p>The Record type is used to describe data aggregations within the algorithms of this
  specification. A Record type value consists of one or more named fields. The value of each field
  is either an ECMAScript value or an abstract value represented by a name associated with the
  Record type. Field names are always enclosed in double brackets, for example [[value]]</p>

  <p>For notational convenience within this specification, an object literal-like syntax can be
  used to express a Record value. For example, {[[field1]]: 42, [[field2]]: <b>false</b>,
  [[field3]]: <b>empty</b>} defines a Record value that has three fields each of which is
  initialised to a specific value. Field name order is not significant. Any fields that are not
  explicitly listed are considered to be absent.</p>

  <p>In specification text and algorithms, dot notation may be used to refer to a specific field of
  a Record value. For example, if R is the record shown in the previous paragraph then R.[[field2]]
  is shorthand for “the field of R named [[field2]]”.</p>

  <p>Schema for commonly used Record field combinations may be named, and that name may be used as
  a prefix to a literal Record value to identify the specific kind of aggregations that is being
  described. For example: PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: 42, [[Writable]]: <b>false</b>,
  [[Configurable]]: <b>true</b>}.</p>
